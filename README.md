# MD Chapter23

We will go through the [notebook file](https://github.com/larsinho/MD_Chapter23/blob/master/Lognormality%20-%20Chapther%2023.ipynb) in class. 

You can also play around with the file by downloading the notebook on your personal computer. If you don't have Jupyter notebook installed, the easiest way to get started is through Anaconda, see for example [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
